# Introduction to Medispeak

Medispeak is an innovative open-source project that revolutionizes how healthcare professionals interact with Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems. By leveraging advanced AI technology, Medispeak enables doctors and nurses to use their voice to fill in EMR records efficiently and accurately.

## Key Features

- **Voice-to-EMR Integration**: Seamlessly convert spoken medical notes into structured EMR data
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works with any EMR system through Chrome extension or web app embedding
- **AI-Powered Understanding**: Advanced AI models for accurate medical transcription and data structuring
- **Privacy-First Design**: Secure handling of sensitive medical information
- **Open Source**: Community-driven development for continuous improvement

## How It Works

1. **Voice Input**: Healthcare professionals speak their medical notes naturally
2. **AI Processing**: 
   - Real-time transcription of speech to text
   - Medical terminology recognition
   - Context-aware structuring of information
3. **EMR Integration**: Automatically fills appropriate EMR fields with structured data
4. **Review & Confirm**: Quick review interface for verifying and editing entries
